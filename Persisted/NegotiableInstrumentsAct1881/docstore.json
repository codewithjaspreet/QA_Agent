Agency. \u2014 Every person capable of binding himself or of being bound, as mentioned in section  \n26, may so bind himself or be bound by a duly authorized agent acting in his name.  \nA general authority to transact business and to receive and discharge debts does not confer upon an \nagent the power of accepting or indorsing bills of exchange so as to bin d his principal.  \nAn authority to draw bills of exchange does not of itself import an authority to indorse.  \n28. Liability of agent signing. \u2014An agent who signs his name to a promissory note, bill of exchange \nor cheque without indicating thereon that he signs  as agent, or that he does not intend thereby to incur \npersonal responsibility, is liable personally on the instrument, except to those who induced him to sign \nupon the belief that the principal only would be held liable.  \n29. Liability of legal representat ive signing. \u2014A legal representative of a deceased person who \nsigns his name to a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is liable personally thereon unless he \nexpressly limits his liability to the extent of the assets received by him as such.  \n30. Liab ility of drawer. \u2014The drawer of a bill of exchange or cheque is bound, in case of dishonour \nby the drawee or acceptor thereof, to compensate the holder, provided due notice of dishonour has been \ngiven to, or received by, the drawer as hereinafter provided.  \n31. Liability of drawee of cheque. \u2014The drawee of a cheque having sufficient funds of the drawer in his \nhands properly applicable to the payment of such cheque must pay the cheque when duly required so to do, \nand , in default of such payment, must compensat e the drawer for any loss or damage caused by such default.  \n32. Liability of maker of note and acceptor of bill. \u2014In the absence of a contract to the contrary, the \nmaker of a promissory note and the acceptor before maturity of a bill of exchange are bound to pay the \namount thereof at maturity according to the apparent tenor of the note or acceptance respectively, and the \nacceptor of a bill of exchange at or after maturity is bound to pay the amount thereof to the holder on demand.  \nIn default of such payment  as aforesaid, such maker or acceptor is bound to compensate any party to \nthe note or bill for any loss or damage sustained by him and caused by such default.  \n                                                           \n1.

Negotiable instrument made, etc., without consideration. \u2014A negotiable instrument made, \ndrawn, accepted, indorsed or transferred without consideration, or for a consideratio n which fails, creates \nno obligation of payment between the parties to the transaction. But if any such party has transferred the \ninstrument with or without indorsement to a holder for consideration, such holder, and every subsequent \nholder deriving title from him, may recover the amount due on such instrument from the transferor for \nconsideration or any prior party thereto.  \nException I.\u2014No party for whose accommodation a negotiable instrument has been made, drawn, \naccepted or indorsed can, if he have paid the amount thereof, recover thereon such amount from any \nperson who became a party to such instrument for his accommodation.  \nException II.\u2014No party to the instrument who has induced any other party to make, draw, accept, indorse \nor transfer the same to him  for a consideration which he has failed to pay or perform in full shall recover \nthereon an amount exceeding the value of the consideration (if any) which he has actually paid or performed.  \n44.

The \nmaker of a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque stands in immediate relation with the payee, and \nthe indorser with his indorsee. Other signers may by agreement stand in immediate relation with a holder.  \nIllustration  \nA draws a bill on B for Rs. 500 payable to the order of A, B accepts the bill, but subsequently dishonours , it by \nnon-payment. A sues B on the bill, B proves that it was accepted for value as to Rs. 400, and as an accommodation to \nthe plaintiff as to the residue. A can only recover Rs. 400.  \n45. Partial failure of consideration not consisting of money .\u2014Where a part of the consideration \nfor which a person signed a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque, though not consisting of money, \nis ascertainable in money without collateral enquiry, and there has been a failure of that part, the sum \nwhich a holder stand ing in immediate relation with such signer is entitled to receive from him is \nproportionally reduced.  \n1[45A.

Negotiation by delivery. \u2014Subject to the provisions of section 58, a promissory note, bil l of \nexchange or cheque payable to bearer is negotiable by delivery thereof.  \nException .\u2014A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque delivered on condition that it is not to \ntake effect except in a certain event is not negotiable (except in the hands of a  holder for value without \nnotice of the condition) unless such event happens.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) A, the holder of a negotiable instrument payable to bearer, delivers it to B's agent to keep for B. The instrument has been  \nnegotiated.  \n(b) A, the holder of a negotiable instrument payable to bearer, which is in the hands of A's banker, who is at the time the \nbanker of B, directs the banker to transfer the instrument to B's credit in the banker's account with B. The banker does so, and \naccordingly now possesses the instrument as B's agent. The instrument has been negotiated, and B has become the holder of it.  \n48. Negotiation by indorsement. \u2014Subject to the provisions of section 58, a promissory note, bill of \nexchange or cheque  1[payable to order], is negotiable by  the holder by indorsement and delivery thereof.  \n49. Conversion of indorsement in blank into indorsement in full. \u2014The holder of a negotiable \ninstrument indorsed in blank may, without signing his own name, by writing above the indorser \u2019s \nsignature a direction to pay to any other person as indorsee, convert the indorsement in blank into an \nindorsement in full; and the holder does not thereby incur the responsibility of an indorser.  \n50. Effect of indorsement. \u2014The indorsement of a negotiable instrument f ollowed by delivery \ntransfers to the indorsee the property therein with the right of further negotiation; but the indorsement \nmay, by express words, restrict or exclude such right, or may merely constitute the indorsee an agent to \nindorse the instrument, o r to receive its contents for the indorser, or for some other specified person.  \nIllustrations  \nB signs the following indorsements on different negotiable instruments payable to bearer. \u2014 \n(a) \u201cPay the contents to C only\u201d.  \n(b) \u201cPay C for my use.\u201d  \n(c)  \u201cPay C or order for the account of B.\u201d  \n(d) \u201cthe within must be credited to C.\u201d  \nThese indorsements exclude the right of further negotiation by C.  \n(e) \u201cPay C.\u201d  \n(f) \u201cPay C value in account with the Oriental Bank.\u201d  \n(g) \u201cPay the contents to C, being part of the c onsideration in a certain deed of assignment executed by C to the indorser \nand others.\u201d  \nThese indorsements do not exclude the right of further negotiation by C.  \n51. Who may negotiate. \u2014Every  sole maker, drawer, payee or indorsee, or all of several joint \nmakers, drawers, payees or indorsees, of a negotiable instrument may, if the negotiability of such \ninstrument has not been restricted or excluded as mentioned in section 50, indorse and negotiate the same.  \nExplanation .\u2014Nothing  in this section enables a mak er or drawer to indorse or negotiate an \ninstrument, unless he is in lawful possession or is holder thereof; or enables a payee or indorsee to indorse \nor negotiate an instrument, unless he is holder thereof.  \nIllustration  \nA bill is drawn payable to A or order.

Acceptance for honour. \u2014When  a bill of exchange has been noted or protested for non -\nacceptance or for better security, any person not being a party already liable thereon may, with the \nconsent of the holder, by writing on the bill, accept the same for the honour of any party thereto. 1*** \n109.  How acceptance for honour must be made. \u2014A person desiring to accept for honour must, \n2[by writing on the bill under his hand,] declare that he accepts under protest the protested bill for the \nhonour of the drawer or of a particular indorser whom  he names, or generally for honour. 3*** \n110. Acceptance not specifying for whose honour it is made. \u2014Where  the acceptance does not \nexpress for whose honour it is made it shall be deemed to be made for the honour of the drawer.  \n111. Liability of acceptor for honour. \u2014An acceptor for honour binds himself to all parties \nsubsequent to the party for whose honour he accepts to pay the amount of the bill if the drawee do not; \nand such party and all prior parties are liable in their respective capacities to compen sate the acceptor for \nhonour for all loss or damage sustained by him in consequence of such acceptance.  \nBut an acceptor for honour is not liable to the holder of the bill unless it is presented, or (in case the \naddress given by such acceptor on the bill is  a place other than the place where the bill is made payable) \nforwarded for presentment, not later than the day next after the day of its maturity.  \n112. When acceptor for honour may be charged. \u2014An acceptor for honour cannot be charged \nunless the bill has a t its maturity been presented to the drawee for payment, and has been dishonoured by \nhim, and noted or protested for such dishonour.  \n113. Payment for honour .\u2014When a bill of exchange has been noted or protested for non -payment, \nany person may pay the same f or the honour of any party liable to pay the same : provided that the person \nso paying  4[or his agent in that behalf] has previously declared before a notary public the party for whose \nhonour he pays, and that such declaration has been recorded by such nota ry public.  \n114.  Right of payer for honour .\u2014Any person so paying is entitled to all the rights in respect of the \nbill, of the holder at the time of such payment, and may recover from the party for whose honour he pays \nall sums so paid, with interest thereon and with all expenses properly incurred in making such payment.  \n115. Drawee in case of need .\u2014Where a drawee in case of need is named in a bill of exchange, or in \nany indorsement thereon, the bill is not dishonoured until it has been dishonoured by such drawee.  \n116. Acceptance and payment without protest .\u2014A drawee in case of need may accept and pay the \nbill of exchange without previous protest.  \nCHAPTER XII  \nO F   C O  M  P  E  N  S  A  T  I  O  N  \n 117. Rules as to compensation .\u2014The compensation payable in case of dishonour of a promissory \nnote, bill of exchange or cheque, by any party liable to the holder or any indorsee, shall  5*** be \ndetermined by the following rules: \u2014 \n(a) the holder is entitled to the amount due upon the instrument together with the expenses \nproperly incurred in presenting, noting and protesting it;  \n                                                           \n1.

Law governing liability of maker, acceptor or indorser of foreign instru ment. \u2014In the absence \nof a contract to the contrary, the liability of the maker or drawer of a foreign promissory note, bill of \nexchange or cheque is regulated in all essential matters by the law of the place where he made the instrument, \nand the respective  liabilities of the acceptor and indorser by the law of the place where the instrument is made \npayable.  \nIllustration  \nA bill of exchange was drawn by A in California, where the rate of interest is 25 per cent., and accepted by B , payable in \nWashington, wher e the rate of interest is 6 per cent. The bill is erdorsed in 3[India],  and is dishonoured. An action on the bill is \nbrought against B in 3[India].  He is liable to pay interest at the rate of 6 per cent. only; but if A is charged as drawer, A is liable to \npay interest at the r ate of 25 per cent.  \n \n135. Law of place of payment governs dishonour. \u2014Where  a promissory note, bill of exchange or \ncheque is made payable in a different place from that in which it is made or indorsed, the law of the place \nwhere it is made payable determines what constitutes dishonour and wh at notice of dishonour is \nsufficient.  \nIllustration  \nA bill of exchange drawn and indorsed in 3[India],  but accepted payable in France, is dishonoured. The indorsee causes it to \nbe protested for such d ishonour, and gives notice thereof in accordance with the law of France, though not in accordance with the \nrules herein contained in respect of bills which are not foreign. The notice is sufficient.  \n136.
