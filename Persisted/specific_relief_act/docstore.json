Alternative prayer for rescission in suit for specific performance .\u2014A plaintiff instituting a suit \nfor the specific  performance of a contract in writing may pray in the alternative that, if the contract cannot \nbe specifically enforced, it may be  rescinded and delivered up to be cancelled; and the court, if it refuses to \nenforce the contract specifically, may direct it to be rescinded and delivered up accordingly.  \n30. Court may require parties rescinding to do equity .\u2014On adjudging the rescission of a contract, \nthe court may require the  party to whom such relief is granted to restore, so far as may be, any benefit which \nhe may have received from the other party and to  make any compensation to him which justice may require.  \nCHAPTER V  \nCANCELLATION OF INSTRUMENTS  \n31. When cancellation may be ordered .\u2014(1) Any person against whom a written instrument is void \nor voidable, and who  has reasonable apprehension that such instrument, if left outstanding may cause him \nserious injury, ma y sue to have it adjudged  void or voidable; and the court may, in its discretion, so adjudge \nit and order it to be delivered up and cancelled.  \n(2) If the instrument has been registered under the Indian Registration Act, 1908  (16 of 1908) , the court \nshall also send a copy of its decree to the officer in whose office the instrument has been so registered; and \nsuch officer shall note on the copy of the instrument contained in his books the fact of its cancellation.  \n32. What instruments may be partially cancel led.\u2014Where an instrument is evidence of different \nrights or different obligations, the court may, in a proper case, cancel it in part and allow it to stand for the \nresidue.  \n33. Power to require benefit to be restored or compensation to be made when instrum ent is \ncancelled or is successfully resisted as being void or voidable .\u2014(1) On adjudging the cancellation of an \ninstrument, the court may require the party to whom such relief is granted, to restore, so far as may be any \nbenefit which he may have received from the other party and to make any compensation  to him which  \njustice may require.  \n(2) Where a defendant successfully resists any suit on the ground \u2014 \n(a) that the instrument sough t to be enforced against him in the suit is voidable, the court may if \nthe d efendant has received  any benefit under the instrument from the other party, require him to restore, \nso far as may be, such benefit to that party or to make compensation for it;  \n(b) that the agreement sought to be enforced against him in the suit is void by reason of his not \nhaving been competent to contract under section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872  (9 of 1872) , the \ncourt may, if the defendant has received any benefit under the agreement from the other party, require \nhim to restore, so far as may b e, such  benefit to that party, to the extent to which he or his estate has \nbenefited thereby . \nCHAPTER VI  \nDECLARATORY DECREES  \n34.

Perpetual injunction when granted .\u2014(1) Subject to the other provisions contained in or referred \nto by this Chapter, a  perpetual injunction may be granted to the plaintiff to prevent the breach of an \nobligation existing in his favour, whether expressly  or by implication.  \n(2) When any such obli gation arises from contract, the court shall be guided by the rules and provisions \ncontained in  Chapter II.  \n(3) When the defendant invades or threatens to invade the plaintiff \u2019s right to, or enjoyment of,  property, \nthe court may  grant a perpetual injunctio n in the following cases, namely: \u2014 \n(a) where the defendant is trustee of the property for the plaintiff;  \n(b) where there exists no standard for ascertaining the actual damage caused, or likely to be caused, \nby the invasion;  \n(c) where the invasion is such that compensation in money would not afford adequate relief;  \n(d) where the injunction is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of judicial proceedings.  \n39. Mandatory injunctions .\u2014When, to prevent the breach of an obligation, it is necessary to compel \nthe per formance of certain acts which the court is capable of enforcing, the court may in its discretion grant \nan injunction to prevent the breach complained of , and also to compel performance of the requisite acts.  \n40.

However, such relief must be specifically claimed in the court proceedings.\n\nSection 23 states that a contract can still be specifically enforced even if it includes a provision for liquidated damages in case of breach, as long as the court determines that the provision was intended to secure performance and not as an option to pay money instead.\n\nSection 24 states that if a suit for specific performance is dismissed, the plaintiff's right to sue for compensation for breach of the contract is barred. However, the plaintiff can still sue for other relief to which they may be entitled.\n\nSection 27 states that a person interested in a contract can sue to have it rescinded in certain cases, such as when the contract is voidable or unlawful and the defendant is more to blame than the plaintiff.\n\nSection 25 states that the provisions of the act regarding contracts also apply to awards and testamentary directions to execute settlements.\n\nSection 36 states that preventive relief can be granted by the court through injunctions, either temporary or perpetual.\n\nSection 38 states that a perpetual injunction can be granted to prevent the breach of an obligation existing in favor of the plaintiff, whether it is expressly or implicitly stated in a contract.\n\nSection 41 states the
