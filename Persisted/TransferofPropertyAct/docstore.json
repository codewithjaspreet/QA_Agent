Conditional transfer to one person coupled with transfer to another on failure of prior \ndisposition .\u2014Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in favour of one person, and \nby the same transaction an ulterior disposition of the same interest is made in favour of another, if the \nprior disposition under the transfer shall fail, the ulterior disposition shall take effect upon the failure of \nthe prior disposition, although the failure may not have occurred in the manner contemplated by the \ntransferor.  \nBut, where the intention of the parties to the transaction is that the ulterior disposition shall take effect \nonly in the event of the prior disposition failing in a particular manner, the ulterior disposition shall not \ntake effect unless the prior disposi tion fails in that manner.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) A transfers Rs. 500 to B on condition that he shall execute a certain lease within three months after A \u2019s death, and, \nif he should neglect to do so, to C.

B is entitled to the farm during her life as \nif no condition had been inserted.  \n31. Condition that transfer shall cease to have effect in case specified uncertain event happens \nor does not happen .\u2014Subject to the provisions of section 12, on a transfer of property an interest therein \nmay be created with the condition superadded that it shall cease to exist in case a specified uncertain \nevent shall happen, or in case a specified uncertain event shall not happen.  \nIllustrations  \n(a) A trans fers a farm to B for his life, with  a proviso that, in case B cuts down a certain wood, the transfer shall cease \nto have any effect.

A transfer of property can be made orally if not expressly required by law. A condition or limitation that absolutely restrains the transferee from parting with or disposing of their interest in the property is void, except in the case of a lease. \n\nThe Act also discusses the operation of transfers, oral transfers, conditions restraining alienation, the rule against perpetuity, transfer to a class of persons, ulterior transfers, and election. It also covers the apportionment of periodical payments, the apportionment of benefits and obligations on severance, and the transfer where a third person is entitled to maintenance. \n\nThe Act further addresses the burden of obligations imposing restrictions on the use of land, transfers by ostensible owners, joint transfers for consideration, and transfers by persons having distinct interests.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16f88870-6f10-4bf0-bf3a-8504ed07c2d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "16f88870-6f10-4bf0-bf3a-8504ed07c2d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "c69a30ca19b189d331bf150f01745bc7973188b81118ed12d2ced8c7c36368fe", "text": "The provided information is from the Transfer of Property Act.pdf document.
