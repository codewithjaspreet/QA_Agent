Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over  its useful life. \nThe depreciable amount of an asset is the cost of an asset or other amount  substituted for cost, less its \nresidual val ue. The useful life of an asset is the period over  which an asset is expected to be available for \nuse by an entity, or the number of production  or similar units expected to be obtained from the asset by \nthe entity.  \n2. For the purpose of this Schedule, the term depreciation includes amortisation.  \n3. Without prejudice to the foregoing provisions of paragraph 1, \u2014 \n(i) In case of such class of companies, as may be prescribed and whose financial  statements \ncomply with the accounting standards prescribed for such class of  companies under section 133 the \nuseful life of an asset shall not normally be different  from the useful life and the residual value shall \nnot be different from that as indicated  in Part C, provided that if such a company uses a useful life or \nresidual value which is  different from the useful life or residual value indicated therein, it shall \ndisclose the  justification for the same.  \n(ii) In respect of other companies the useful life of an asset shall not be longer  than the useful life \nand the residu al value shall not be higher than that prescribed in  Part C.  \n(iii) For intangible assets, the provisions of the Accounting Standards mentioned  under sub -para \n(i) or ( ii), as applicable, shall apply.  \nPART \u2017B\u2018  \n4. The useful life or residual value of any specific asset, as notified for accounting  purposes by a \nRegulatory Authority constituted under an Act of Parliament or by the Central  Government shall be \napplied in calculating the depreciation to be provided for such asset  irrespective of the requirement s of \nthis Schedule.  \nPART \u2017C\u2018  \n5.
