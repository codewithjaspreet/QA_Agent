If the proposal prescribes a manner in which it is to be accepted, and the \nacceptance is not made in such manner, the proposer may, within a reasonable time after the \nacceptance is communicated to him, insist that his proposal shall be accepted in the prescribed \nmanner, and not otherwise; but if he fails to do  so, he accepts the acceptance.  \n8. Acceptance by performing conditio ns, or receiving consideration .\u2014Performance of the \nconditions of a proposal, or the acceptance of any consideration for a reciprocal promise which may be \noffered with a proposal, is an acc eptance of the proposal.  \n9. Promises, express and implied .\u2014In so far as the proposal or acceptance of any promise is made \nin words, the promise is said to be express. In so far as such proposal or acceptance is made otherwise \nthan in words, the  promise is said to be implied.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a153a7b-5093-4e49-a3f4-e000bec994f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a153a7b-5093-4e49-a3f4-e000bec994f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "Indian Contract 1872 act.pdf", "file_path": "drive/MyDrive/Data/Indian Contract 1872 act.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 568075, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-15", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fb4863d7-6a70-4169-ab5a-10182389e028", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "Indian Contract 1872 act.pdf", "file_path": "drive/MyDrive/Data/Indian Contract 1872 act.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 568075, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-15", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "4bf8bbbff95feead46ee4b3151a0b6d5ee933b092af65da2d4fa7923601cc2d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c30cdd0f-b673-4061-b4f2-5b38054eefbf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "Indian Contract 1872 act.pdf", "file_path": "drive/MyDrive/Data/Indian Contract 1872 act.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 568075, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-15", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "35faacedd10b8b961b7b2dbd2ad23a2dcbad948e28e0b444021e810553756e6f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3e02158e-fbba-46ae-a488-2763514b6efd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "Indian Contract 1872 act.pdf", "file_path": "drive/MyDrive/Data/Indian Contract 1872 act.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 568075, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-15", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "dbb077e71609ca4440bfedc7adb9e1c496f9f7d0c603d89a05daa6340d02b8cf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "17552bc7cadce9a93806afbdb87f93351c1f7c6e185e34b9ab28403cc1b6f3ff", "text": "13 \n CHAPTER II  \nOF CONTRACTS,  VOIDABL E CONTRACTS AND VOID AGREEMENTS  \n10.

B examines the accounts of the factory, which show that only four hundred maunds of indigo have been made. After thi s \nB buys the factory. The contract is not voidable on account of A \u2019s misrepresent ation.  \n(c) A fraudulently informs B that A \u2019s estate is free from in  cumbrance. B thereupon buys the estate. The estate is subject to a \nmortgage. B may either avoid the contract, or may insist on its being carried out and the mortgage d ebt redeemed.  \n(d) B, having discovered a vein of ore on the estate of A, adopts means to conceal, and does conceal, the existence of the ore \nfrom A. Through A \u2019s ignorance B is enabled to buy the estate at an under -value.

The person \ndelivering the  goods is called the \u201cbailor \u201d. The person to whom they are delivered is called, the \u201cbailee \u201d. \nExplanation .\u2014If a person already in possession of the goods of another contracts to hold them as a \nbailee, he thereby becomes the bailee, and the owner becomes th e bailor of such goods, although they \nmay not have bee n delivered by way of bailment.  \n149. Delivery to bailee how made .\u2014The delivery to the bailee may be made by doing anything \nwhich has the effect of putting the goods in the possession of the intended bai lee or of any person \nauthori zed to hold them on his behalf.  \n150.Bailor \u2019s duty to d isclose faults in goods bailed .\u2014The bailor is bound to disclose to the bailee \nfaults in the goods bailed, of which the bailor is  aware, and which materially interfere with the use of \nthem, or expose the bailee to extraordinary risks; and if he does not make such disclosure, he is \nresponsible for damage arising to the ba ilee directly from such faults.  \nIf the goods are bailed for hire, the bailor is responsible for such damage , whether he was or was not \naware of the existence of s uch faults in the goods bailed.  \nIllustrations  \n(a)A lends a horse, which he knows to be vicious, to B. He does not disclose the fact that the horse is vicious. The horse \nruns away. B is thrown and injured. A is respons ible to B for damage sustained.  \n(b)A hires a carriage of B. The carriage is unsafe, though B is not aware of it, and A is injured. B is r esponsible to A for the \ninjury.  \n1151. Care to be taken by bailee .\u2014In all cases of bailment the bai lee is bound to take as much care \nof the goods bailed to him as a man of ordinary prudence would, under similar circumstances, take of his \nown goods of the same bulk, quality and value as the goods bailed2. \n152.Bailee when not liable for loss,  etc., of thing bailed. \u2014The bailee, in the absence of any special \ncontract, is not responsible for the loss, destruction or deterioration of the thing bailed, if he has taken the \namount of care of it described in section 151.  \n153. Termination of bailment by bailee \u2019s act inconsistent with conditions .\u2014A contract of \nbailment is avoidable at the option of the ba ilor, if the bailee does any act with regard to the goods bailed, \ninconsistent with the conditions of th e bailment.  \nIllustration  \nA lets  to B, for hire, a horse for his own riding. B drives the horse in his carriage. This is, at the \u2018option of A,  a termination \nof the bailment.  \n154. Liability of bailee making un authorized use of goods bailed .\u2014If the bailee mak es any use of \nthe goods bailed which is not according to the conditions of the bailment, he is liable to make \ncompensation to the bailor for any damage arising to the goods from or during such use of them.  \n                                                           \n1.
