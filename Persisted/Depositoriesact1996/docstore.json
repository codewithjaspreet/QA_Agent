The Board can also examine the record of the proceedings and enhance the penalty if necessary. \n\nPage 9 states that the procedure for settlement under this Act follows the rules specified by the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992. It also mentions the powers of the Recovery Officer to recover amounts due from individuals who fail to pay penalties or comply with directions issued by the Board. The Recovery Officer can use various modes such as attachment and sale of property, arrest, or appointing a receiver. The Recovery Officer can seek assistance from the local district administration, and the recovery of amounts takes precedence over other claims. \n\nPage 10 introduces the concept of continuance of proceedings in case of the death of a person. The legal representative of the deceased person becomes liable to pay any sum that the deceased would have been liable to pay. Proceedings initiated against the deceased can be continued against the legal representative, and proceedings that could have been initiated against the deceased can be initiated against the legal representative. \n\nPage 11 discusses the contravention by companies. If a company commits a contravention, the person in charge of the company at the time of the contravention, as well as the company itself, will be deemed guilty and liable to be punished. However, if the person proves that the offence was committed without their knowledge or that they took all due diligence to prevent it, they will not be liable. If the contravention was committed with the consent or neglect of a director, manager, secretary, or other officer of the company, they will also be deemed guilty and liable to be punished. \n\nPage 12 mentions the establishment of Special Courts for the speedy trial of offences under this Act. The Central Government can establish or designate these courts. A Special Court consists of a single judge who must be a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge.
